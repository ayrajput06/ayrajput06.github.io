    <h1>My Job</h1>
    <h2> Transfer Transition Program Intern </h2>

    <p>I am currently an intern at the Transfer Transition Program. In my position as a student intern, I supervise and lead a team of five student coordinators. My role includes planning and execution of events and catering to a diverse student group. A part of my role also allows me to mentor and help prospective students ensure they make the right choice.</p>
    
    <p>As a representative of the Transfer Transition Program, I promote TTP services. I collaborate with campus partner offices, giving presentations at events or tabling at resource fairs to promote TTP. I also participate in campus outreach campaigns such as Wisconsin Welcome, Parent & Family Weekend, and National Transfer Student Week.</p>
    
    <p>I provide support and guidance for new and continuing transfer students. This includes conducting one-on-one meetings with prospective, admitted, or enrolled students. I engage with students at the Transfer Engagement Center and at TTP events, fostering a positive, inclusive, and supportive climate in student spaces. I facilitate connections between transfers and new people, resources, and experiences.</p>
    
    <p>Through TTP, I receive training and development in outreach and mentorship. This includes communication strategies such as Motivational Interviewing and Positive Psychology. I explore and grow my leadership through the challenge-support model and strengths-based coaching. I also delve into theories and practices related to social justice, identity development, and student development. Additionally, I learn strategies for difficult conversations and giving feedback.</p>
