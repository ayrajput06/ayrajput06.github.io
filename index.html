        <p>Hey! I am Apurva Rajput, a freshman at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Economics. I am passionate about technology and its potential to solve real-world problems.</p>
    
    <p>On campus, I am an active member of the baking club, where I get to share my love for baking with fellow enthusiasts. I am also involved with WACM, where I participate in events and initiatives aimed at promoting diversity in the field of computing.</p>
    
    <p>When I'm not immersed in my studies, I love to travel and explore new places. My travel adventures have taken me to various exciting destinations, each offering unique experiences and memories. I also enjoy keeping up with the latest fashion trends and experimenting with different styles. As a huge foodie, I am always on the lookout for new culinary delights to try, whether it's a trendy new restaurant or a hidden gem.</p>
    
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading, hiking, and spending time with friends and family. I believe in maintaining a balanced lifestyle and making the most of my college experience.
